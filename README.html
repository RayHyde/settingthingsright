<p><h1>Setting Things Right</h1></p>
<p>Just a way of drawing attention to the orderliness of your product or service. It does not calculate anything, it just animates the text lines to their final position, size and opacity.</p>
<p>Everything is done with CSS animations, with a few lines of jQuery to start things off at the button click and to add and remove class names.</p>
<p>Why the fish? Well, I was hungry at the time of writing this...</p>

<p><h2>My Playground</h2></p>
<p>This project is part of my Playground - a collection of fun (and dare I say it: clever) stuff I made in the past, from jQuery games and plugins to CSS animation tricks.</p>
